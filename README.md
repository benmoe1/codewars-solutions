# codewars-solutions
This repository contains my solutions of [codewars](https://www.codewars.com) katas.

At this time I've done almost every challenge in JavaScript but I plan to use other languages regularly as well.
Please note: Odds are that there are possibly more efficient solutions from time to time as I'm still learning, but I try to revisit my solutions from time to time.
## Future Goals ##
- [ ] Try to solve all JavaScript Katas with Python
- [ ] Solve at least 5 Katas with Go
- [ ] Solve at least 5 Katas with PHP
